# DestyFinder

## Overview
**DestyFinder** is a web-based application built using **CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and React** that visually demonstrates various pathfinding algorithms. It helps users understand how algorithms like **BFS**, **DFS**, **A\***, **Prim's**, and others work by providing a visual, step-by-step simulation of their processes.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Visualization**: Observe the step-by-step execution of different pathfinding algorithms.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implementations of popular algorithms such as:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
  - **A\*** (A-Star)
  - **Prim's Algorithm** (for minimal spanning trees)
- **Customizable Grid**: Users can modify the grid size, add obstacles, and set start and end points for the pathfinding process.
- **Responsive Design**: Works smoothly across different screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**:
  - **HTML/CSS**: Used to structure and style the application interface.
  - **JavaScript**: Handles the logic behind the pathfinding algorithms.
  - **React.js**: Provides dynamic rendering and a responsive UI for the pathfinding visualizer.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
